for lamuto algorithm last element we will always consider the pivot element
the pivot element will be at the correct position but it will take more time as compared to the hoare's algorithm.


hoare's algorithm
first element is pivot element

the position of the pivot will not be neccesary in the right place.

but takes less time them lamoto algorithm.
