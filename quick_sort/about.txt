quick sort works along a partition algorithm where the whole array is partitioned along this element only. the smaller element is putted to the left of the partition
where the greater element is to the right_side.

divide and conquer algorithm

O(n^2)

best algorithm due to
1. in place algorithm
2. cache friendly
3. average time complexity is O(nlogn)
4. tail recursive

3 partition algorithm naive,lamuto,hoare

naive is stable

lamuto and hoare are not stable
