This repository consists all the various way i can think of to solve a program. it is having 3 levels currently :-
1. naive - mostly beginers thinking and use of brute force, if problem is new how to tackle.
2. efficient - Intermediate level of thinking with small experience
3. more_efficient - Best I can think of for now.

Every problem statment has a built in time time diffrence calculator. you can use some large input to compare the time taken by codes. 
don't put very large number in naive otherwise it will take infinite time.

This will be an active repo with weekly or monthly updation.
