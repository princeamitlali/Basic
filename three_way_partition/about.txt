given an element having more than two types of element and we have to segregate them , three common type are :-

1. multiple pivot -
ex = [1,5,9.4,8,3,7,3,2,1]
pivot == 3

result == [1,2,1,3,3,5,9,4,8,7]

2.sort array of 0's 1's and 2's

ex == [1,0,2,2,1,1,0,1]

result == [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2]

3. pivot in a range 
ex == [1,0,2,9,3,8,4,7,5,6]
pivot = [3,5]

result [0,1,2,3,4,5,9,8,7,6]
