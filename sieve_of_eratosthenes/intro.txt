The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so (Ref Wiki).

Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by the Eratostheneâ€™s method: 
When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime.

Basic principal is all multiples of prime are not prime and every prime having no divisor other than one and self.
so if me marked all multiple as false only prime numbers left.
