suppose we have an array of element n 

li = [2,4,6,-5,15,7]

the element we can call equilibrium if the sum of array left side of that is equal
to the sum of element on the right side of that element

left -> 2+4+6-5 = 11
right -> 11

thus 15 is equilibrium point

ex 2 

li = [1,2,3] is not having any equilibrium point

corner cases

li= [4,2,-1] is having 4 as equilibrium point

li = [2,-2,4] is also having equilibrium point
